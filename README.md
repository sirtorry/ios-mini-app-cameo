# ios-mini-app-cameo


Milestone Submission - Due: Monday, September 26 @ 11:55 PM


2 pts: App can launch properly

6 pts: A list appears with at least 3 items in it

8 pts: You can swipe to check off an item / undo a check off

4 pts: Doesnâ€™t crash / looks reasonable


Tasks for Patrick (to be partially delegated to Torry when he is up to date):


Create the list UI in Main.storyboard

Create a list table with the proper design for list elements

Ensure that it looks correct, and that rotating it does not cause it to look any less ideal

Connect the UI to ViewController.swift

Program the swiping attributes in the table cell class that should have been created when adding the table cell to the UI


Tasks for Torry:

Find a way to use Xcode, either on your computer or in the lab.

Learn briefly how to use Xcode. Here is a helpful tutorial: https://www.lynda.com/Swift-tutorials/iOS-8-App-Development-Swift-1-Essential-Training/185036-2.html

Pull the code from the repository. Review the current code to understand everything written so far.

Add an App icon from http://www.appicon.build/ to our project.

Let Patrick know when you have done all of this so he can assign you more tasks.

At the end: Test the app on the iPod while reviewing the rubric to ensure everything works as expected.
